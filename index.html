            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <section>
                <p>Unforeseen disasters, tragic accidents, and emergency situations are all unavoidable elements of reality. The emergency response systems put in place here in the United States are often the only things standing between life and death in times of crisis. When these systems fail, or cannot perform to the fullest extent of their abilities, people lose their lives. As it stands now, there are too many accidents involving emergency vehicles and in particularly dense population centers, emergency vehicles often have trouble moving at the pace that the situation sometimes demands. While they serve their purposes, lights and sirens only work so well and by the time a driver becomes aware of an emergency vehicle, it is not always easy to get out of the way instantaneously, costing the emergency vehicle precious seconds.</p>
                <p>With modern technology, we aim to change this. We devised a system that will allow emergency vehicles to broadcast their location to nearby vehicles on the road. With this early notice, vehicles can start making way for emergency responders earlier, allowing for the emergency vehicles to move faster with fewer delays. This will also decrease the risk of the emergency vehicle itself getting into an accident while responding to emergency situations. As we explored this problem and the wireless technologies available, we realized that there were two vastly different directions from which to approach the problem â€“ radio frequency broadcasting and client / server communication. Instead of choosing one, we have opted to explore both options and observe the differences and tradeoffs of each.</p>
